### Design
Form Mail is an old web app that was used by users of a website to contact it. The email of a company is preprogrammed.

### Assumptions
#### 1. Fallacy of parameter
Parameters by their definition change. The designer failed to ask "what if somebody could change the *email recipient* parameter?".
